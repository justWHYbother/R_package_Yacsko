```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

(Here we add the libraries used in this package)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

(If you need to install packages not previously used in class, ex: genomics)

```{r}
install.packages("vcfr")
```

(Now, we install our own R package)

```{r}
devtools::install_github("natyac/R_Package_Yacsko")
```

(Final part- downloading data for our R package)

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paleantology/GBIO153H/master/data/Phenology_data.csv", destfile = "/cloud/project/data/Phenology_data.csv")
```

(Now we start the actual tutorial)

## Working example

+ An example of each function and how it works
+ Say something about why this is a good thing to do
+ Say something about expected output
(Do this for each function)

(Ex:)

```{r}
library(project)
result <- avg(Ants = result, ColumnGenus = Myrmecia)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
